I read some papers about basic Multi-Objective Optimisation tech and its application.



[What Weights Work for You? Adapting Weights for Any Pareto Front Shape in Decomposition-based Evolutionary Multi-Objective Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.02679.pdf)

**basic**:

adapting weights



Robot Trajectory Planning Using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm Optimization



[Expensive Multiobjective Optimization for Robotics](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mtesch/publications/ICRA2013.pdf)

Evolutionary multi-objective optimization in robot soccer system for education

An Approach to Multi-Objective Path Planning Optimization for Underwater Gliders

**application**:
